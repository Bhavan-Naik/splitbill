# 🧾 SplitBill

SplitBill is a smart and simple app that helps you fairly split bills among friends, family, or any group of people based on what each person actually consumed. Whether it's a dinner out, a bar tab, or a group order, SplitBill ensures everyone pays their fair share - no more, no less.

# 🚀 Features

✅ Itemized Bill Splitting: Enter what each person ordered - no more dividing bills evenly when some ordered more.

✅ Support for Groups: Split bills between any number of people.

✅ Fair Calculations: Taxes and tips are proportionally divided based on each person’s total.

✅ User-Friendly Interface: Designed to make splitting bills quick, accurate, and painless.

✅ Group Sharing (optional): Share the breakdown with friends via link, email, or QR code.

# 💡 Why SplitBill?

We've all been there - someone had a salad, someone else had two drinks and a full meal, and yet the bill gets split evenly. It's awkward, unfair, and sometimes frustrating. SplitBill solves this problem by helping groups split expenses based on actual consumption. It removes the guesswork and ensures everyone pays exactly what they owe.

# 🛠️ How It Works

Add People: Enter the names of everyone in the group.

Add Items: Input each item from the bill and assign it to the person (or people) who consumed it.

Include Tax and Tip: Add any service charges, tax, or tip percentages.

Get Results: View a breakdown of who owes what, including tax and tip portions.

Share: Easily send the results to the group.
